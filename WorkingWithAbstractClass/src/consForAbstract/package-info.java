/*
we make Abstract class to hide the implementation the procedure
and showing the functionality to user, abstract class have everything 
which have the a normal class,like constructor implementation and much more thing 

Then Question arises why do we make abstract class
Suppose there are many classes which has some common functionality then if we
want with them all, so we have to solution either 
1-we write every functionality in that classes every time.
2- we can write once and use no. of times we want
so make a super class of all  of them as abstract class and extend them in all
if some property is same but functionality is different then make that method 
abstract and inherit them in all and define accordingly. 
for example -:
there is Super class Animal-
there are some more animals like dog cat lion and many more
